# README for `02-deep-research`

> [!NOTE]
> Under development; coming soon!

This project explores an emerging, popular application pattern for AI; <em>deep research</em>. 

In a typical scenario, a user asks for detailed information about a topic, for example the market performance and financials for a publicly-traded company, agents find relevant data from diverse sources, and finally an LLM digests the information retrieved and prepares a report. 

This example will demonstrate Llama Stack support for agent-based application development, including the use of protocols like <a href="#model-context-protocol-section">MCP</a>.
